The outlierCorrection scripts contains code that identifies, visualizes and corrects outliers in the SweDia database. It outputs csv-files with outlier corrected formant data, that is read in by the main manuscript/rmd.

As for the manual correction of outliers, we decided to manually correct all outliers with a normalized density of less than .05. We first checked the segmentation boundaries in the Praat textgrids. Next, we manually measured new formant values using visual approximation of time points and Praat's function *Formant: Formant listing*. When the formant value generated diverged substantially from that talker's general value for that time point and that vowel, and/or the formant track did not follow a stable path in the spectrogram, the spectrogram was read manually by clicking the formant and reading off the value at the horizontal line. We then imported the corrected formant data for the outliers to overwrite the automatically obtained formants.
