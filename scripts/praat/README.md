This folder contains Praat scripts of two types: vowel analyzer scripts for automatic extraction of formant values, and synthesizer scripts for resynthesis of vowels.
The vowel analyzer scripts measure formants in English vowels (vowel_analyzer.praat) or in Swedish vowels (vowel_analyzer_swe.praat). There is also a vowel analyzer script that is adapted to measure formants on vowel data from the SweDia database (vowel_analyzer_swedia.praat).
The vowel synthesizer scripts are of two types: either they perform random sampling inside the script (vowel_synthesizer.praat) or they are given a file with cue statistics for each individual token to resynthesize (vowel_synthesizer_nosampling.praat). There is also a version of this latter script that resynthesize tokens in Hz space (instead of height backness space; vowel_synthesizer_nosampling_f1f2space.praat).
