This results in a `damped' vowel quality that appears to be rather unusual in a typological perspective. To date, however, no experimental studies of this vowel type have been carried out using Swedish material. In this paper, formant frequencies are presented for one dialect suggesting that the /i/ vs. /y/ contrast has been neutralized, and that the resulting vowel should be associated with unrounded high central [\O ]. This hypothesis was corroborated by an articulatory simulation. It is thus suggested that the damped vowels found in the Swedish dialects are members of a relatively common vowel type. This was further supported by preliminary perceptual evidence suggesting that Swedish listeners accept Turkish [\O ] as an instance of the Swedish damped vowel and, conversely, that Turkish listeners accept this vowel as an instance of Turkish [\O ].},

  abstract = {Most modern studies of Swedish phonology take the view that the underlying vowel inventory of Central Standard Swedish comprises nine, rather than seventeen or eighteen, mutually contrasting vowel phonemes. A residual problem of a classic phonological type concerns the borrowed entities, rendered in traditional Swedish orthography as au and eu, whose `status in the vowel system is unclear' (Riad 2014:42). The present paper scrutinizes earlier and current phonological interpretations of these entities, adduces evidence for and against each proposal, and concludes that the case for treating them as phonemic diphthongs /V{\fontencoding{LECO}\selectfont\char225}V/, as /VC/-sequences, or as monosyllabic /V{\textsubarch V}/-sequences is weak and that they should in the first place be viewed as underlying heterosyllabic vowel sequences /VV/, subject to a special phonological stipulation valid for a borrowed sub-domain of the lexicon. Typologically, Central Standard Swedish should continue to be subsumed under the category of languages that lack phonological diphthongs.},

Methods: (1) A large-scale online perception experiment testing listeners' abilities to identify the two vowels and (2) acoustic analysis of 705 vowels from 19 speakers. Results: The perception study shows that listeners classify the horizontally centralized /y:/ as /i:/, both in isolated vowel items and in items containing the full word. This indicates that /y:/ is moving into the perceptual space of /i:/. Listeners also classify the unmerged /y:/ as /i:/ when listening to [y:] in isolation, indicating that lip rounding is a perceptually weak feature, for this centralized vowel, in this variety. The acoustic analysis shows that /i:/ tends to be produced as [ɨ:], and that there is no acoustic difference between /i:/ and /y:/ in measurements correlated with the first two formants, i.e. lip rounding is the most important distinctive feature. Conclusion: Results point in the direction of an incipient vowel merger, following a merger-by-approximation model. These results indicate a lack of perceptual strength of an articulatory feature in the disappearing phoneme, namely lip rounding, and the consequent perceptual similarities between the horizontally centralized [ɨ:] and /y:/.},

Hillenbrand et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 97, 3099–3111 (1995)]. However, in the earlier study all utterances were recorded in a constant /hVd/ environment. The main purpose of the present study was to determine whether a close relationship between vowel identity and spectral change patterns is maintained when the consonant environment is allowed to vary. Recordings were made of six men and six women producing eight vowels (/i,ɪ,ɛ,æ,ɑ,ᴜ,u,ʌ/) in isolation and in CVC syllables. The CVC utterances consisted of all combinations of seven initial consonants (/h,b,d,g,p,t,k/) and six final consonants (/b,d,g,p,t,k/). Formant frequencies for F1–F3 were measured every 5 ms during the vowel using an interactive editing tool. Results showed highly significant effects of phonetic environment. As with an earlier study of this type, particularly large shifts in formant patterns were seen for rounded vowels in alveolar environments [K. Stevens and A. House, J. Speech Hear. Res. 6, 111–128 (1963)]. Despite these context effects, substantial improvements in category separability were observed when a pattern classifier incorporated spectral change information. Modeling work showed that many aspects of listener behavior could be accounted for by a fairly simple pattern classifier incorporating F0, duration, and two discrete samples of the formant pattern.}",

These were examined using two types of measures, one based on ``long-term distributional'' (LTD) methods, and the other based on specific landmarks in speech that are linguistic in nature (``linguistic'' measures). The various methods were used to identify whether and on what basis or bases speakers of these two languages differ in f0 range. Findings yielded significant cross-language differences in both dimensions of f0 range, but effect sizes were found to be larger for span than for level, and for linguistic than for LTD measures. The linguistic measures also uncovered some differences between the two languages in how f0 range varies through an intonation contour. This helps shed light on the relation between intonational structure and f0 range.},

In all three varieties, the high vowels /i{$\Elzlmrk$}/, /y{$\Elzlmrk$}/, /ʉ{$\Elzlmrk$}/ and /u{$\Elzlmrk$}/ turn out to only marginally glide, if at all, and /e{$\Elzlmrk$}/ exhibits clear diphthongization of a centralizing nature. For /o{$\Elzlmrk$}/, a similar centralization is found in Stockholm, but none is found in Link\"oping, and the reverse is found in Lund. /{$\varepsilon\Elzlmrk$}/, /\o{$\Elzlmrk$}/ and /ɑ{$\Elzlmrk$}/ do not diphthongize, but /{$\varepsilon\Elzlmrk$}/ and /\o{$\Elzlmrk$}/ are realized strikingly low in all three varieties, suggesting an alternative transcription as /\ae{$\Elzlmrk$}/ and /\oe{$\Elzlmrk$}/. An additional finding is that geminate consonants are hardly longer than singleton consonants, so that the fundamental Swedish binary distinction between VC{$\Elzlmrk$} and V{$\Elzlmrk$}C syllable types nowadays has to rely on differences in vowel duration, vowel quality, and diphthongization. Diphthongization may thus be an instrument in the maintenance of auditory contrast.},

  abstract = {Abstract Speech sound contrasts differ along multiple phonetic dimensions. During speech perception, listeners must decide which cues are relevant, and determine the relative importance of each cue, while also integrating other, signal-external cues. The comparison of cue weighting in perception and production bears on a range of theoretical issues including the processes underlying sound change, the time course of learning, the nature of cues, and the perception-production interface. Research examining the relative alignment of cue weighting across the modalities, on both a community and individual level, has revealed both parallels and asymmetries between the modalities. The extraordinarily wide range of ways that have been used to conceptualize and quantify cue weights reflects the inherent theoretical, methodological, and analytical differences between the two modalities. More consideration of the choices of analytical metrics, explicit discussion of the theoretical assumptions that underlie them, and systematic investigations of different types of cues will lead to more generalizable findings that can be incorporated into computational implementable models of speech processing.

We examine /u/-fronting and /j/-dropping in data from three generations of Derby English speakers. We analyze dynamic formant data and auditory judgments, using mixed effects regression methods, including generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs). /u/-fronting is reaching its end-point, showing complex conditioning by context and a frequency effect that weakens over time. /j/-dropping is declining, with low-frequency words showing more innovative variants with /j/ than high-frequency words. The two processes interact: words with variable /j/-dropping (new) exhibit more fronting than words that never have /j/ (noodle) even when the /j/ is deleted. These results support models of change that rely on phonetically detailed representations for both word- and sound-level cognitive units.},

  abstract = {Abstract The extreme acoustic variability of speech is well established, which makes the proficiency of human speech perception all the more impressive. Speech perception, like perception in any modality, is relative to context, and this provides a means to normalize the acoustic variability in the speech signal. Acoustic context effects in speech perception have been widely documented, but a clear understanding of how these effects relate to each other across stimuli, timescales, and acoustic domains is lacking. Here we review the influences that spectral context, temporal context, and spectrotemporal context have on speech perception. Studies are organized in terms of whether the context precedes the target (forward effects) or follows it (backward effects), and whether the context is adjacent to the target (proximal) or temporally removed from it (distal). Special cases where proximal and distal contexts have competing influences on perception are also considered. Across studies, a common theme emerges: acoustic differences between contexts and targets are perceptually magnified, producing contrast effects that facilitate perception of target sounds and words. This indicates enhanced sensitivity to changes in the acoustic environment, which maximizes the amount of potential information that can be transmitted to the perceiver.

    abstract = "{Research on the perception of vowels in the last several years has given rise to new conceptions of vowels as articulatory, acoustic, and perceptual events. Starting from a ‘‘simple’’ target model in which vowels were characterized articulatorily as static vocal tract shapes and acoustically as points in a first and second formant (F1/F2) vowel space, this paper briefly traces the evolution of vowel theory in the 1970s and 1980s in two directions. (1) Elaborated target models represent vowels as target zones in perceptual spaces whose dimensions are specified as formant ratios. These models have been developed primarily to account for perceivers’ solution of the ‘‘speaker normalization’’ problem. (2) Dynamic specification models emphasize the importance of formant trajectory patterns in specifying vowel identity. These models deal primarily with the problem of ‘‘target undershoot’’ associated with the coarticulation of vowels with consonants in natural speech and with the issue of ‘‘vowel‐inherent spectral change’’ or diphthongization of English vowels. Perceptual studies are summarized that motivate these theoretical developments.}",

Chistovich's work on defining a critical distance for the SCG effect is closely related to two of the most fundamental problems in speech communication research: the relation between acoustic attributes and phonemic features and the problem of invariance despite large acoustic differences between speakers. Firstly, experimental findings relating to the SCG effect are reviewed. Secondly, a model incorporating these perceptual effects is described, and thirdly, three aspects of the model are discussed: (1) the resulting feature analysis, (2) normalization, and (3) acoustic variability as represented in the model and its relation to Stevens' quantal theory of speech production.},

To investigate this issue, a study has been made on the vowels of 132 Australian English speakers (male and female). The degree of vowel separation from the formant values at the target was contrasted to that from modeling the formant contour with discrete cosine transform coefficients. The findings are that, although it is necessary to model the formant contour to separate out the diphthongs, the formant values at the target, plus vowel duration are sufficient to separate out the monophthongs. However, further analysis revealed that there are formant contour differences which benefit the within-class separation of the tense/lax monophthong pairs.}",

Faced with a similar problem, we made a limited number of surface changes to FAVE-Align so that it \textendash{} along with its original hidden Markov models for English \textendash{} could be used on Stockholm Swedish. We tested the performance of this prototype on the three main sociolects of Stockholm Swedish and found that read-aloud alignments met all of the minimal benchmarks set by the literature. Spontaneous-speech alignments met three of the four minimal benchmarks. We conclude that an adaptation such as ours would especially suit laboratory experiments in Nordic phonetics that rely on elicited speech.},
