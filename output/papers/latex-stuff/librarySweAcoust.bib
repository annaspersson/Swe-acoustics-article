  abstract = {Several experiments have found that changing the intrinsic f0 of a vowel can have an effect on perceived vowel quality. It has been suggested that these shifts may occur because f0 is involved in the specification of vowel quality in the same way as the formant frequencies. Another possibility is that f0 affects vowel quality indirectly, by changing a listener's assumptions about characteristics of a speaker who is likely to have uttered the vowel. In the experiment outlined here, participants were asked to listen to vowels differing in terms of f0 and their formant frequencies and report vowel quality and the apparent speaker's gender and size on a trial-by-trial basis. The results presented here suggest that f0 affects vowel quality mainly indirectly via its effects on the apparent-speaker characteristics; however, f0 may also have some residual direct effects on vowel quality. Furthermore, the formant frequencies were also found to have significant indirect effects on vowel quality by way of their strong influence on the apparent speaker.},

  abstract = {In scattered Swedish dialects, the vowels /i/ and /y/ are pronounced with a markedly low F2. This results in a `damped' vowel quality that appears to be rather unusual in a typological perspective. To date, however, no experimental studies of this vowel type have been carried out using Swedish material. In this paper, formant frequencies are presented for one dialect suggesting that the /i/ vs. /y/ contrast has been neutralized, and that the resulting vowel should be associated with unrounded high central [\O ]. This hypothesis was corroborated by an articulatory simulation. It is thus suggested that the damped vowels found in the Swedish dialects are members of a relatively common vowel type. This was further supported by preliminary perceptual evidence suggesting that Swedish listeners accept Turkish [\O ] as an instance of the Swedish damped vowel and, conversely, that Turkish listeners accept this vowel as an instance of Turkish [\O ].},

  abstract = {Most modern studies of Swedish phonology take the view that the underlying vowel inventory of Central Standard Swedish comprises nine, rather than seventeen or eighteen, mutually contrasting vowel phonemes. A residual problem of a classic phonological type concerns the borrowed entities, rendered in traditional Swedish orthography as au and eu, whose `status in the vowel system is unclear' (Riad 2014:42). The present paper scrutinizes earlier and current phonological interpretations of these entities, adduces evidence for and against each proposal, and concludes that the case for treating them as phonemic diphthongs /V{\fontencoding{LECO}\selectfont\char225}V/, as /VC/-sequences, or as monosyllabic /V{\textsubarch V}/-sequences is weak and that they should in the first place be viewed as underlying heterosyllabic vowel sequences /VV/, subject to a special phonological stipulation valid for a borrowed sub-domain of the lexicon. Typologically, Central Standard Swedish should continue to be subsumed under the category of languages that lack phonological diphthongs.},

Methods: (1) A large-scale online perception experiment testing listeners' abilities to identify the two vowels and (2) acoustic analysis of 705 vowels from 19 speakers. Results: The perception study shows that listeners classify the horizontally centralized /y:/ as /i:/, both in isolated vowel items and in items containing the full word. This indicates that /y:/ is moving into the perceptual space of /i:/. Listeners also classify the unmerged /y:/ as /i:/ when listening to [y:] in isolation, indicating that lip rounding is a perceptually weak feature, for this centralized vowel, in this variety. The acoustic analysis shows that /i:/ tends to be produced as [ɨ:], and that there is no acoustic difference between /i:/ and /y:/ in measurements correlated with the first two formants, i.e. lip rounding is the most important distinctive feature. Conclusion: Results point in the direction of an incipient vowel merger, following a merger-by-approximation model. These results indicate a lack of perceptual strength of an articulatory feature in the disappearing phoneme, namely lip rounding, and the consequent perceptual similarities between the horizontally centralized [ɨ:] and /y:/.},

The vowel [o:] does not group with [ø:], as has been suggested, and [α:], although rounded, has a pattern dissimilar to all other vowels. The short vowels show patterns similar to their long counterparts with reduced activity and duration.}

This acoustic variation in the ``same'' words of language presents a practical problem for linguists and engineers, as well as a theoretical problem in the study of speech perception. This chapter reviews some practical vowel-normalization methods and discusses the perceptual processes that listeners may use to accomplish speech recognition in the face of talker variation, with a general overview of cortical organization for talker normalization and speech perception. The chapter reviews evidence that there are aspects of auditory processing that help remove talker differences during speech perception - in auditory spectral encoding; and in contrast coding in an auditory frame of reference that seems to apply before lexical processing begins.},

EMG onset times for rounded vowels in initial position{$\cdot$}were found to be longer and more variable than the same vowels in non-initial position. These findings are discussed. The pattern of the EMG integrated curves indicate a predictable heterogeneity in labial activity which corresponds favourably to the traditional articulatory classification of rounding type.},

These were examined using two types of measures, one based on ``long-term distributional'' (LTD) methods, and the other based on specific landmarks in speech that are linguistic in nature (``linguistic'' measures). The various methods were used to identify whether and on what basis or bases speakers of these two languages differ in f0 range. Findings yielded significant cross-language differences in both dimensions of f0 range, but effect sizes were found to be larger for span than for level, and for linguistic than for LTD measures. The linguistic measures also uncovered some differences between the two languages in how f0 range varies through an intonation contour. This helps shed light on the relation between intonational structure and f0 range.},

The results obtained in this study show how some articulatory parameters are affected by the influence of expressiveness in speech for a selection of Swedish vowels.

In all three varieties, the high vowels /i{$\Elzlmrk$}/, /y{$\Elzlmrk$}/, /ʉ{$\Elzlmrk$}/ and /u{$\Elzlmrk$}/ turn out to only marginally glide, if at all, and /e{$\Elzlmrk$}/ exhibits clear diphthongization of a centralizing nature. For /o{$\Elzlmrk$}/, a similar centralization is found in Stockholm, but none is found in Link\"oping, and the reverse is found in Lund. /{$\varepsilon\Elzlmrk$}/, /\o{$\Elzlmrk$}/ and /ɑ{$\Elzlmrk$}/ do not diphthongize, but /{$\varepsilon\Elzlmrk$}/ and /\o{$\Elzlmrk$}/ are realized strikingly low in all three varieties, suggesting an alternative transcription as /\ae{$\Elzlmrk$}/ and /\oe{$\Elzlmrk$}/. An additional finding is that geminate consonants are hardly longer than singleton consonants, so that the fundamental Swedish binary distinction between VC{$\Elzlmrk$} and V{$\Elzlmrk$}C syllable types nowadays has to rely on differences in vowel duration, vowel quality, and diphthongization. Diphthongization may thus be an instrument in the maintenance of auditory contrast.},

  abstract = {Abstract Speech sound contrasts differ along multiple phonetic dimensions. During speech perception, listeners must decide which cues are relevant, and determine the relative importance of each cue, while also integrating other, signal-external cues. The comparison of cue weighting in perception and production bears on a range of theoretical issues including the processes underlying sound change, the time course of learning, the nature of cues, and the perception-production interface. Research examining the relative alignment of cue weighting across the modalities, on both a community and individual level, has revealed both parallels and asymmetries between the modalities. The extraordinarily wide range of ways that have been used to conceptualize and quantify cue weights reflects the inherent theoretical, methodological, and analytical differences between the two modalities. More consideration of the choices of analytical metrics, explicit discussion of the theoretical assumptions that underlie them, and systematic investigations of different types of cues will lead to more generalizable findings that can be incorporated into computational implementable models of speech processing.

We examine /u/-fronting and /j/-dropping in data from three generations of Derby English speakers. We analyze dynamic formant data and auditory judgments, using mixed effects regression methods, including generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs). /u/-fronting is reaching its end-point, showing complex conditioning by context and a frequency effect that weakens over time. /j/-dropping is declining, with low-frequency words showing more innovative variants with /j/ than high-frequency words. The two processes interact: words with variable /j/-dropping (new) exhibit more fronting than words that never have /j/ (noodle) even when the /j/ is deleted. These results support models of change that rely on phonetically detailed representations for both word- and sound-level cognitive units.},

  abstract = {Abstract The extreme acoustic variability of speech is well established, which makes the proficiency of human speech perception all the more impressive. Speech perception, like perception in any modality, is relative to context, and this provides a means to normalize the acoustic variability in the speech signal. Acoustic context effects in speech perception have been widely documented, but a clear understanding of how these effects relate to each other across stimuli, timescales, and acoustic domains is lacking. Here we review the influences that spectral context, temporal context, and spectrotemporal context have on speech perception. Studies are organized in terms of whether the context precedes the target (forward effects) or follows it (backward effects), and whether the context is adjacent to the target (proximal) or temporally removed from it (distal). Special cases where proximal and distal contexts have competing influences on perception are also considered. Across studies, a common theme emerges: acoustic differences between contexts and targets are perceptually magnified, producing contrast effects that facilitate perception of target sounds and words. This indicates enhanced sensitivity to changes in the acoustic environment, which maximizes the amount of potential information that can be transmitted to the perceiver.

  abstract = {Locus equations were employed to phonetically describe stop place categories as a function of syllable-initial, -medial, and -final position. Ten speakers, five male and five female, produced a total of 2700 CVC and 4500 VCV utterances that were acoustically analyzed to obtain F2 onset, F2 vowel, and F2 offset frequencies for locus equation regression analyses. In general, degree of coarticulation, as indexed by locus equation slope, was reduced for post-vocalic (VC) stops relative to pre-vocalic stops (pooled data from initial and medial positions), but significant differences were observed as a function of stop consonant. All stops showed significantly reduced R2 values and increased standard errors of estimate for VC relative to CV productions. Separability of stop place categories in a higher-order slope X y-intercept acoustic space also diminished for VC vs CV stop productions. The degradation of classic locus equation form (high correlation and linearity) for VC relative to CV productions was attributed to greater articulatory precision in the production of pre-vocalic compared to post-vocalic stops. This greater articulatory precision was interpreted as reflecting a greater need to normalize vowel context-induced variability of the F2 transition for syllable onset relative to final stops. The decline in acoustic lawfulness of syllable-final stops is discussed in terms of coarticulatory interactions and expected perceptual correlates.},

  abstract = {This paper describes some of the implications of Ludmilla Chistovich's "spectral center of gravity" (SCG) effect for a model of the auditory representation of American English vowels. Chistovich's work on defining a critical distance for the SCG effect is closely related to two of the most fundamental problems in speech communication research: the relation between acoustic attributes and phonemic features and the problem of invariance despite large acoustic differences between speakers. Firstly, experimental findings relating to the SCG effect are reviewed. Secondly, a model incorporating these perceptual effects is described, and thirdly, three aspects of the model are discussed: (1) the resulting feature analysis, (2) normalization, and (3) acoustic variability as represented in the model and its relation to Stevens' quantal theory of speech production.},

  abstract = {We propose a rapid adaptation of FAVE-Align to the Nordic languages, and we offer our own adaptation to Swedish as a template. This study is motivated by the fact that researchers of lesser-studied languages often neither have sufficient speech material nor sufficient time to train a forced aligner. Faced with a similar problem, we made a limited number of surface changes to FAVE-Align so that it \textendash{} along with its original hidden Markov models for English \textendash{} could be used on Stockholm Swedish. We tested the performance of this prototype on the three main sociolects of Stockholm Swedish and found that read-aloud alignments met all of the minimal benchmarks set by the literature. Spontaneous-speech alignments met three of the four minimal benchmarks. We conclude that an adaptation such as ours would especially suit laboratory experiments in Nordic phonetics that rely on elicited speech.},
