# Abstract
The Swedish vowel space is a relatively densely populated space with 21 categories that differ in quality and quantity. Existing descriptions of the entire space rest on recordings made in the late 1990s or earlier, while recent work in general has focused on parts of the space. The present paper reports two studies. The first study presents static and dynamic acoustic analyses of the entire vowel space using a recently released database of *h-VOWEL-d* words (SwehVd). The second study compares the acoustic characteristics of SwehVd against formant data from 8 talkers of the same variety recorded in 1999 [@eriksson2004], to investigate the extent to which the phonetic realization of vowels has changed over the last generation. The results highlight the importance of F1, F2, duration and formant dynamics for Swedish vowel category distinction, and indicate possibly ongoing shifts in the high front part of the space.

# Introduction {#sec:intro}
The Swedish vowel inventory consists of 21 categories that differ in spectral (formant frequencies) and temporal cues (duration). It forms a typologically rather complex space, characterized by a systematic quantity distinction resulting in 9 long and short vowel pairs, 3 different levels of lip-rounding, and contextually conditioned allophones to /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`/ and /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`/ in position before /r/ or retroflex segments. Given the crowdedness of the space and resulting category overlap for some vowels, previous work has reported on the importance of additional cues besides the two primary determinants to vowel identity cross-linguistically---the first two formants, F1 and F2 [e.g., @joos1948; @Ladefoged1957; @nearey-assmann1986; @peterson1961]---as well as the need to look beyond static point estimates of F1 and F2. For instance, the third formant (F3) for rounded vs. unrounded categories [e.g., @fant1959; @fant1969; @fujimura1967; @kuronen2000], formant dynamics for several neighboring categories in the front part of the space [@kuronen2000; @pelzer-boersma2019], and duration for certain vowel pairs [@behne-kirk1997]. 

This paper investigates the acoustic characteristics of modern-day Swedish vowels in two studies that aim to contribute to our understanding of language-specific and langue-general patterns of vowel acoustics. The first study presents a comprehensive description of the primary acoustic cues to vowel identity, using a recently released database of *h-VOWEL-d* (short: hVd) words recorded by 44 male and female talkers of Swedish, the SwehVd database [@persson-jaeger2023]. The second study assesses whether the Swedish vowel space has been submitted to changes over the last generation, by comparing the acoustics of SwehVd against that of a reference material from 1999 [@eriksson2004]. The variety investigated is Central Swedish, the regional standard variety of Swedish spoken in an area around and beyond Stockholm (eastern Svealand), including Mälardalssvenska, Sveamål, Uppsvenska, Mellansvenska [e.g., @bruce2009; @elert1994; @riad2014].^[For the reader unfamiliar with Central Swedish, Section \@ref(sec:sweVowels) provides an overview of the acoustics of Central Swedish vowel space.] 
Existing descriptions of the entire space of 21 vowels rest on recordings made more than 25 years ago [reported in, e.g., @engstrand1999; @kuronen2000; @leinonen2010; @riad2014]. Two of the most recent studies are @leinonen2010 and @kuronen2000 (Table \@ref(tab:previous-work)). The former is based on recordings obtained around 1999 of all vowels, of which four short vowels were omitted from analysis. It covers 98 rural locations in Sweden and Swedish-speaking parts of Finland, including reference talkers of Standard Swedish. The latter covers the entire vowel space but is based on recordings from 1981 [@leinonen1982]. More recent work over the last two decades has focused on parts of the phonological space, such as the long vowels for studies on diphthongization [@pelzer-boersma2019], two vowels for merger studies [e.g., [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`] in @wenner2010], or a single vowel, such as the damped [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɨː")`] [@schotz2011], see Table \@ref(tab:previous-work). These studies all provide detailed mappings of different parts of the space, and contribute with important insights into ongoing processes and shifts. However, given their focus on subsets of the space, acoustic mappings of the modern-day Central Swedish vowel space *in its entirety* are largely lacking. Given that there is some evidence that productions of minimal pairs can lead to enhanced contrasts [e.g., @schertz2013; @seyfarth2016], it remains an open question how representative such subsets are for the vowel space as a whole. In addition, most previous studies differ in the materials used, in terms of the size of the database (e.g., number of talkers, number of repetitions per vowel), the demographics of talkers (e.g., male/female talkers, region of origin), and phonological contexts used for recording. For instance, the majority of previous studies have either not held the phonetic context constant across vowels, or have investigated isolated vowel production out of context or in different CVC contexts (Table \@ref(tab:previous-work)). This diversity restricts comparison across studies on Swedish, as well as cross-linguistically.

The materials and methodological approach adopted in the current paper is motivated by the goal to complement previous work for a comprehensive picture of modern-day Central Swedish vowels. The first study provides an up-to-date acoustic description of the entire Central Swedish vowel space of 21 categories, using the SwehVd database [@persson-jaeger2023]. The use of an hVd database minimizes coarticulatory effects from the surrounding phonetic context, and increases cross-linguistic comparability [e.g., @hillenbrand1995; @Peterson1952]. The main spectral and temporal cues to vowel identity are reported in static analyses [following e.g., @engstrand1999; @fant1969], as well as dynamic analyses, given the well documented importance of formant dynamics on vowel production and perception [e.g., @assmann-katz2005; @eklund1997; @hillenbrand-nearey1999; @kuronen2000; @nearey-assmann1986]. In contrast with previous work investigating the dynamics of Central Swedish vowels, the present study includes both long and short vowels, thus submitting the entire vowel space to the same analyses. 

The static analysis assesses what cues contribute to vowel distinctions and evaluates some of the claims introduced in previous work, such as the hypothesized importance of F3 for rounded vs. unrounded high front vowel distinctions [@fant1959; @fant1969; @fujimura1967; @kuronen2000], and to what extent spectral and temporal cues contribute to long-short vowel pair distinctions [e.g., @behne-kirk1997; @kuronen2000]. The dynamic analysis explores what part of the space seems more prone to diphthongization, and investigates how formant dynamics contribute to category distinctions in Central Swedish.

Anticipating some of the main results from Study 1, the acoustic analyses suggested differences in the phonetic realization of some vowels compared to other qualitative descriptions of Central Swedish [@eklund1997; @engstrand1999; @fant1969; @kuronen2000; @riad2014]. These included the fronting of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`], the lowering of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`], and the centralization of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] [c.f., @leinonen2010; @pelzer-boersma2019; @schotz2011]. This led me to conduct Study 2, which aimed to assess the scope and spread of these changes over the last generation, by comparing the acoustic characteristics of SwehVd against vowel data from a database of 8 (female = 4) talkers of Central Swedish recorded in 1999 as part of the SweDia dialect project [@eriksson2004].

The paper is organized as follows. A background to the acoustics of Central Swedish vowels is provided by a review of previous work. This is followed by the two studies' methods and results, and finally, a discussion of the results and its consequences for the Central Swedish vowel system. 
All analyses and visualization code for this study can be found in an online repository (<https://osf.io/7uvj4/>).

## The acoustics of Central Swedish vowels {#sec:sweVowels}
This section provides a description of the overall inventory of Central Swedish monophthongs, and discusses the role of cues beyond F1 and F2. It furthermore presents a review of previous studies on diphthongization and formant dynamics.

Central Swedish is most often described as having nine vowel phonemes: /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("i")`/, /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("y")`/, /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉ")`/, /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("e")`/, /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`/, /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`/, /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɑ")`/, /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("o")`/, /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("u")`/. The long allophones are [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("øː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɑː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`], and the short allophones are [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("a")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʊ")`]. The short allophones of /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("e")`/ and /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`/ has been reported to neutralize as [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`] in Central Swedish, resulting in 17 vowels, rather than 18 [@riad2014]. There is also evidence of neutralization of the short /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`/ and /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉ")`/ as [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`] among some talkers of Central Swedish, primarily in position before a retroflex [@stahle1965; @wenner2010]. In addition to these 17 vowels, there are 4 additional long and short allophones---[`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œː")`], and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`], as /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`/ and /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`/ lower in position before /r/ or any retroflex segment [e.g., @kuronen2000; @riad2014]. Traditionally, Central Swedish has been described using four height levels and three backness levels [@riad2014].

It has furthermore been suggested that Central Swedish is defined by three levels of lip-rounding, where the rounded vowels are traditionally referred to as either inrounded, with an extreme narrowing of the lips---[`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`], or outrounded, with less degree of lip narrowing and more protruded lips---[`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("øː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] [e.g., @fant1971; @mcallister1974]<!--add: for a critique on the no of levels fo rounding, see-->. Previous work has claimed that lip-rounding is particularly important for some vowel distinctions, especially closely located high vowels. For instance, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] have been described as overlapping in F1-F2 space, but as more separable when F3 is considered [@fant1959; @fant1969; @fujimura1967; @kuronen2000].

The 9 vowel pairs have been reported to differ systematically in duration, with short-long vowel to vowel ratios on average .65-.67 for Central Swedish [@elert1964; @kuronen2000; @strangert2001]. Spectral differences between pairs have traditionally been interpreted as a consequence of the durational distinction, hence assuming a trading relationship between spectral and temporal cues [for a review, see @schaeffler2005]. It has been hypothesized that most of the durational variation is carried by F2 [e.g., @kuronen2000; @lindblom1963]. Previous work has found the largest spectral differences for the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`], and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɑː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("a")`] vowel pairs, and the smallest differences for [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`], and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("øː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`] [e.g., @kuronen2000]. For pairs with small spectral differences, duration is presumably of importance for vowel distinction. Perceptual studies on synthesized speech from talkers of Stockholm Swedish have confirmed that duration is the primary cue for [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`], and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`] [@behne-kirk1997; for results on Southern Swedish and additional vowel pairs, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("øː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`], see @haddingkoch1964].^[What variety of Swedish the listeners spoke was however not reported in @behne-kirk1997.] The extent to which duration is cue to long-short distinctions *across all* vowel pairs is less known, as studies have focused on subsets of pairs.

Accordings to previous work, several of the long vowels in Central Swedish tend to diphthongize in their phonetic realization. Diphthongization is considered prosodically conditioned and is the strongest in stressed vowels [e.g., @bleckert1987; @leinonen2010].^[In general, true phonological diphthongs are not considered part of the phonological inventory of Central Swedish [@eliasson2022].] Previous studies have characterized the diphthongal glide in the later part of the long vowels as either a centralization of the vowel segment towards [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ə")`] or a more open quality, or as a consonantal offglide [e.g., @elert1981; @elert2000; @fant1969; @fant1971; @kuronen2000; @mcallister1974; @pelzer-boersma2019; @riad2014]. Results are inconclusive as to how widespread diphthongization is across the vowel space, and what direction it takes. Most work has however found substantial diphthongization towards a more open quality for the mid and mid-high vowels [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("øː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] [e.g., @eklund1997; @elert2000; @fant1969; @pelzer-boersma2019]. In addition, results have shown that diphthongization cues vowel distinctions for several of the high vowels ([`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`], and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`]) [e.g., @fant1971]. For instance, @kuronen2000 reported that [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`], and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`], differed in formant patterns only at later time-points of the vowel for some talkers in his study. He also found that the contrast between [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`] was maintained solely by trajectory movements. Of importance for the present study, less is known about the formant dynamics in the short vowels, given the almost exclusive focus on the long vowels in studies on diphthongization.

Some talkers of Central Swedish have been reported to realize [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`] with a consonantal offglide, where the end-point of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] is described as a palatal approximant [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("j")`], the end-point of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] a voiced labio-palatal approximant [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɥ")`], the end-point of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`] a voiced bilabial fricative [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("β")`] [@elert1980; @hammarstrom-norman1957; @mcallister1974]. Furthermore, both [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] can be damped and produced with a buzzing sound, phonetically realized as [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɨː")`]. The damped [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɨː")`] has been found in several dialects across Sweden, both in rural areas and in the cities of Gothenburg and Stockholm [@bjorsten-engstrand1999; @elert1980; @engstrand2000; @gross2020; @riad2014]. In work on Swedish dialectology, it is often referred to as the Viby-*i*, and in the Stockholm area, as the Lidingö-*i*. Acoustically, it manifests primarily as a lowering of F2, thus occupying a more centralized position in the F1-F2 space. @schotz2011 describe it as a central palatal vowel, as the articulatory correlates involve a retracted and lower tongue position, the tip of the tongue being higher than blade and dorsum.

# Study 1: Static and dynamic analyses of the spectral and temporal properties of Central Swedish {#sec:swehVd-static}
Study 1 describes the spectral acoustics of Central Swedish in static and dynamic analyses of F0, F1, F2, F3, and duration. While fundamental frequency (F0) is not considered an important cue to vowel identity in itself, it is known to vary between languages, dialects and speech styles [e.g., @henton2005; @jacewicz-fox2018; @johnson2005; @mennen2012; @weirich2019] and is therefore reported. Measurements of vowel duration are included to capture the systematic quantity distinction between long-short vowel pairs in Central Swedish. 

Study 1 aims to provide a detailed description of the acoustics of Central Swedish vowels, and to evaluate the relative importance of certain cues for some vowel distinctions, as hypothesized in previous work. These include the importance of lip-rounding (F3) for high vowel distinctions [@fant1959; @fant1969; @fujimura1967; @kuronen2000], to what extent (all) long-short vowel pairs differ in quality (formants) and quantity (duration) [e.g., @behne-kirk1997; @kuronen2000], and what vowels seem to undergo diphthongization [@kuronen2000; @pelzer-boersma2019]. The dynamic analysis furthermore explores which cues carry information about vowel quality once dynamic information is considered.

The methodology employed for the static and dynamic analyses in Study 1 is next presented, beginning with a description of the materials used.

## Methods
### Materials {#sec:swehVd}
The materials used in Study 1 is a corpus of Swedish hVd word recordings, collected by Anna Persson and Maryann Tan (Stockholm University) in 2020-2024, the SwehVd. An initial version of the corpus with 24 female talkers is described in @persson-jaeger2023. For this paper, an updated release is presented, including 20 additional male talkers (targeted number of male talkers = 24). All recordings, annotations, and acoustic measurements are available at <https://osf.io/ruxnb/>. 
SwehVd was collected with the goal to characterize the contemporary Central Swedish spoken in the Greater Stockholm area or surroundings (provinces of Södermanland, Uppland), within and across talkers. It covers the entire monophthong inventory of Central Swedish, including all nine long vowels (*hid*, *hyd*, *hud*, *hed*, *häd*, *höd*, *had*, *håd*, *hod*), eight short vowels (*hidd*, *hydd*, *hudd*, *hedd*, *hädd*, *hödd*, *hadd*, *hådd*, *hodd*), and four additional allophones in the position before retroflex segments (*härd*, *härr*, *hörd*, *hörr*). SwehVd focuses on a single regional variety, providing high resolution within and across talkers for this variety with N = 10 recordings of each hVd word (for a total of 220 recordings for the 22 different hVd words) from each of the N = `r n_distinct(d.SwehVd$Talker)` talkers (N = `r nrow(d.SwehVd %>% filter(Gender == "female") %>% distinct(Talker))` female), a total N of tokens = `r nrow(d.SwehVd %>% distinct(Talker, category, Token))`. All talkers in the database were L1 talkers of Swedish, born and raised in the Greater Stockholm area, of 20-40 years of age (mean age = `r mean(d.SwehVd$Age) %>% round(digits = 0)`; SD = `r sd(d.SwehVd$Age) %>% round(digits = 2)`).

For the vast majority of talkers in the SwehVd, *hädd* productions elicited the same vowel as *hedd* (see Supplementary Information---SI, Figure \@ref(fig:SI-hedd)), which confirms the commonly held assumption that the short allophone of /e/ neutralizes with the short allophone of /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`/ in Central Swedish. In order to have a balanced number of tokens for each vowel, all *hädd* words were excluded from the subsetted SwehVd materials used in this study [following @persson-jaeger2023]. Recordings on which the talker did not produce the targeted vowel were also excluded.^[The SwehVd database contains information on both targeted vowel and what vowel was actually produced.] Furthermore, outliers were identified and removed by estimating the relative probability of each token's F1-F2 values given the joint distribution of F1-F2 for that vowel and talker. Points outside of the `r 100 * (outlier_probability_cutoff/2)`th to `r 100 * (1 - outlier_probability_cutoff/2)`th quantile of the bivariate Gaussian distribution of each vowel and Talker were filtered out. To facilitate empirical analyses and statistical models, all talkers (N = `r n_distinct(d.SwehVd.exclusions$Talker)`) with fewer than 4 remaining recordings for at least one of the vowels were removed. This left data from `r n_distinct(d.SwehVd$Talker)` L1 talkers (N=`r (d.SwehVd %>% filter(Gender == "female") %>% summarise(n_distinct(Talker)) %>% pull())` female talkers), with on average `r d.SwehVd.forStudy %>% filter(timepoint == 50) %>% group_by(category) %>% tally() %>% summarise(x = mean(n)) %>% pull() %>% round(digits = 0)` (SD = `r d.SwehVd.forStudy %>% filter(timepoint == 50) %>% group_by(category) %>% tally() %>% summarise(x = sd(n)) %>% pull() %>% round(digits = 1)`) tokens per vowel (range = `r d.SwehVd.forStudy %>% filter(timepoint == 50) %>% group_by(category) %>% tally() %>% summarise(x = min(n)) %>% pull() %>% round(digits = 0)` to `r d.SwehVd.forStudy %>% filter(timepoint == 50) %>% group_by(category) %>% tally() %>% summarise(x = max(n)) %>% pull() %>% round(digits = 0)`), for a total of `r nrow(d.SwehVd.forStudy %>% filter(timepoint == 50))` observations. For more details on the recruitment, recording, pre-processing, segmentation and annotation procedure, see @persson-jaeger2023.

### Acoustic analyses
#### Measuring acoustic cues to vowel identity {#sec:cueMeasures}
The Swedish version of the Montreal Forced Aligner developed by @young2021 was used to obtain estimates of word and segment boundaries. The boundaries were then manually corrected by the author (an L1-talker of Swedish). The formant analysis was carried out in Praat [@boersma-weenink2022], using the Burg algorithm to extract estimates of the first three formants (F1-F3) at five time-points of the vowel (20, 35, 50, 65, 80% into the vowel), while vowel duration and F0 were extracted across the entire vowel segment. The Burg algorithm was parameterized with a time step of 0.01 seconds, a window length of 0.025 seconds, and pre-emphasis was applied from 50 Hz. The maximum number of formants was set to 5, with a formant ceiling of 5500 Hz for the female talkers, and 5000 Hz for the male talkers.

#### Vowel normalization
The raw formant values were transformed into a vowel normalized space using Nearey's uniform scaling account [@nearey1978]. Vowel normalization is used in studies on vowel production and perception to account for acoustically irrelevant inter-talker variation, as caused by differences in anatomical structure, e.g., vocal tract size [for reviews see e.g., @barreda-nearey2018; @johnson-sjerps2021; @stilp2020]. In vowel production studies such as the present, normalization is primarily used as a methodological tool. The effect of normalization on the SwehVd data is visualized in Figure \@ref(fig:swe-vowels). Transforming the formant data into a normalized space reduces differences in F1 and F2 due to physiology, which can result in increased category separability, as visualized in Figure \@ref(fig:swe-vowels) (compare left and right panel). 

Previous work on Swedish has analyzed vowel data using primarily Bark-transformed data [@fant1983; @kuronen2000; @schotz2011; @wenner2010], Mel-transformed data [@lindblom1963], Lobanov-normalized data [@gross2020], or unnormalized raw Hertz [@bjorsten-engstrand1999; @fant1969; @pelzer-boersma2019]. The choice of Nearey's uniform scaling in the present study was motivated by its previous use in socio-phonetic research to describe and compare languages and varieties [e.g., @barreda2021; @labov2001; @labov-boberg2005], and by its plausibility as perceptual model of how we come to achieve robust cross-talker perception, as it has provided a good fit against both production [e.g., @persson-jaeger2023; @syrdal1985] and perception data [e.g., @barreda2021; @persson2024]. Henceforth, all analyses presented were applied on the normalized vowel data. Formant measurements in Hertz are reported in the SI, Section \@ref(sec:SI-raw).

(ref:swe-vowels) The SwehVd vowel data in unnormalized Hertz (*left*) and Nearey's uniform scaling space (*right*), along the first two formants, F1 and F2. Points show recordings of each of the 21 Central Swedish vowels by 44 (24 female) L1 talkers in the database, averaged across the three middle time-points (at 35, 50, 65% into the vowel). Vowel labels are placed at the vowel mean across talkers. Long vowels are boldfaced. Vowels that mismatched intended label are excluded (`r signif((d.SwehVd %>% filter(Transcribed_vowel != "targeted") %>% nrow() / d.SwehVd %>% nrow()) * 100)`% of all recordings).

#### Static acoustic analysis
The static analysis of SwehVd presents formant measurements at the steady state of the vowel, by averaging across the three mid-points.^[The choice of time-point for extracting formants, or whether to average across several time-points, affects the acoustic characterizations given how formants move across the vowel segment. The SI (\@ref(sec:SI-measurement-points)) presents evaluations of the effect of different measurement points. For increased comparability across studies in this paper, the steady state of the vowel was selected for both studies.] It maps the entire vowel space of 21 categories and evaluates the relative contribution of F0, F1, F2, F3 and duration to vowel distinctions, using visualizations of cues and cue correlations.

In order to evaluate the hypothesized importance of lip-rounding (F3) for neighboring unrounded and rounded categories, a category separability index was employed. Following work by @wedel2018 and @xie-jaeger2020, each vowel's separability from the neighboring vowel was calculated as the average distance of vowel tokens to the centroid of the neighboring vowel, operationalized as \@ref(eq:category-separability). 

\begin{equation}
 separability \ of /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`/ from /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`/ = \frac{\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} \sqrt{(F1_{token \ k \ of /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`/} - F1_{Center \ of /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`/})^2 + (F2_{token \ k \ of /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`/} - F2_{Center \ of /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`/})^2}}{n} (\#eq:category-separability)
\end{equation}

For instance, for the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] contrast, first, each talker's [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] center was calculated for F1-F2. Next, the distances between each [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] token to the neighboring [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] center from the same talker were calculated for F1-F2. Finally, the distances were averaged across all [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] tokens from a talker, resulting in a separability measure for that vowel and talker. The same was subsequently done for F1-F2-F3. These two measures of separability for each contrast were then compared to assess whether including F3 would lead to increased category separability.

The category separability index provides a relatively straightforward non-parametric measure of distances between categories in the acoustic space, however, without making strong assumptions about perception. The contrasts investigated were [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʊ")`].

To obtain a measure of the magnitude of effect of including F3, separate linear mixed-effects model (LMM) were fit for each category, comparing the separability indices obtained assuming different cue spaces. The LMMs thus predicted the separability index from cue space, with talkers as random effect. The \texttt{lmer()} function from the \texttt{R} package \texttt{lme4} was used. Example of model code: $separability \sim cues + (1|Talker)$. Cue dimension was sum-coded, using the \texttt{contr.sum()} function from the \texttt{R} package \texttt{stats} (F1-F2 = 1, F1-F2-F3 = -1).

The same separability index was also used to assess what cue space provided the largest separability between the two vowels in each long-short vowel pairs. For this evaluation of what spectral cues could best distinguish between categories in each quantity contrast, the category separability index was calculated for each pair and four different cue combinations: F1-F2, F1-F3, F2-F3 or F1-F2-F3. Separate LMMs were fit for each long-short vowel pair, using the same c

#### Dynamic acoustic analysis
Formant measurements at all five time-points were used in the dynamic analysis to assess the importance of formant dynamics for vowel distinctions. The dynamic analysis is divided into two main sections. In the first section, formant trajectory plots were used to assess the scope and direction of formant movements, and to what extent vowels seem to diphthongize or merely display movements. The trajectory plots were also used to evaluate the hypothesized importance of formant trajectories for the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`]-[`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`]-[`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`]-[`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`]-[`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`] contrasts, as reported in previous work [e.g., @kuronen2000; @pelzer-boersma2019], and to explore trajectories in the short vowels.

In the second part of the dynamic analysis, the hypothesized contribution of formant dynamics to category information was modeled using generalized additive mixed-effects models (GAMMs) [@baayen2017]. GAMMs were employed to assess the relative contribution of each cue to category distinctions once formant dynamics was considered, while also accounting for by-talker variability. This type of model has not only a temporal structure (formant measurements at different time-points), but also a hierarchical structure, as individual measurements were grouped into formant contours that in turn were grouped by talkers and gender. Both the complex dependencies generated by this structure as well as the non-monotonic behavior of formants, cannot easily be captured by traditional parametric methods, such as linear regression. GAMMs can accommodate these nonlinear relationships between predictors and response variables [e.g., @soskuthy2021]. Much like other types of mixed models, they allow for the inclusion of random effects, which provides a parsimonious way to account for dependencies in grouped data. 

GAMMs are increasingly used in phonetic research, due to their suitability in modeling complex phonetic patterns without having to rely on simplifying assumptions of linearity or that vowels can be reduced to a single F1-F2 point estimate [e.g., @chuang2021; @soskuthy2021; @wieling2018]. They have been used in studies on vowels in different English varieties, e.g., on /u/-fronting in Derby English [@soskuthy2018], on the front vowel system of Southern American English [@renwick-stanley2020], but to the best of my knowledge, they have not yet been implemented in studies of Swedish vowels. The use of GAMMs thus complements previous work on Central Swedish that has primarily used visual inspection, formant measurements and linear models (Table \@ref(tab:previous-work)).

GAMMs were fit to all 21 categories, as well as to the long and short vowels separately, using the \texttt{bam()} function from the \texttt{R} package \texttt{mgcv}. Example of model code: $F1 \sim category + Gender + s(timepoint, by = category, k = 5) + s(Talker, bs = "re") + s(Talker, category, bs = "re")$. The first set of GAMMs were fit to the long and short vowels separately. Here, vowel was backwards difference coded with [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] as reference categories in each set, using the \texttt{contr.sdif()} function from the \texttt{R} package \texttt{MASS}. The second set was fit to all 21 categories, aiming for an evaluation of differences between categories within vowel pairs. Vowel was backwards difference coded with [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] as reference vowel. The vowel variable was ordered alternating long and short vowels by the pair, in order for the short vowel to be compared against its preceding long counterpart. Visualizations of GAMMs were generated using the \texttt{plot\_smooth()} function from the \texttt{R} package \texttt{itsadug}.

The GAMMs were fit separately for each of the formants, which necessarily meant committing to the simplifying assumption of cue independence. Previous work has shown that acoustic cues tend to co-vary [for a review, see @schertz-clare2019]. For vowels, this is the case for F1 and F2, as shown by the shape and orientation of ellipses in Figure \@ref(fig:swe-vowels-by-quantity).

Next, the results of the static and dynamic analyses are presented.

## Results
### Static spectral and temporal cues to vowel identity
The static analysis begins with an evaluation of where in the F1-F2 space Central Swedish vowels live. Next, the relative contribution of additional cues beyond F1 and F2 is assessed, as well as the extent to which all long-short vowel pairs are qualitatively and quantitatively different.

Figure \@ref(fig:swe-vowels-by-quantity), left panel, visualizes the long vowels along the two primary cues to vowel identity, F1-F2.^[The SI presents the mean cue values for the male and female talkers, Tables \@ref(tab:SI-cue-values-long) and \@ref(tab:SI-cue-values-short). As expected, the male talkers have lower formant values and lower F0s than the female talkers (average F0 across long and short categories for female talkers = `r round(d.cue.values %>% filter(Gender == "female") %>% ungroup() %>% summarise(mean = mean(F0.mean)) %>% pull(mean), digits = 0)`, for male talkers = `r round(d.cue.values %>% filter(Gender == "male") %>% ungroup() %>% summarise(mean = mean(F0.mean)) %>% pull(mean), digits = 0)`).] Four vowels cluster in the high front part of the space. The mid-high [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] occupies a substantially higher position than in many previous descriptions, and is also the most fronted vowel [c.f., @fant1969; @kuronen2000; but see @engstrand2000; @pelzer-boersma2019]. The high [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] are rather mid-central, and exhibit substantial overlap with [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`]. The [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`], and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`] categories are also partly overlapping.

The short vowels (right panel), present a slightly more compact space, however with increased category separability [c.f., @riad2014].^[There is a possibility that the increased separability found for the short vowels is partly an artifact of how time-points for cue measurements were selected. Time-points based on percentage of vowel duration will necessarily render measurement points that are closer in time for the shorter vowels, potentially providing a better estimate of the formant value that is most distinctive, i.e., the steady state in the center of the vowel.] For some vowel pairs, overlap is clearly reduced for the short vowels, e.g., for [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æ")`], and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʊ")`]. Of note, the high vowels [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`] are more fronted than their long counterparts, which does not replicate previous studies on Central Swedish [e.g., @fant1971; @kuronen2000].<!--check leinonen-->

#### Cues and cue correlations
For the pairwise combinations of the five spectral and temporal cues---F0, F1, F2, F3 and duration, see Figure \@ref(fig:swe-vowels-all-cues) from @persson-jaeger2023 updated to include data from 20 male talkers. The densities along the diagonal suggest that F0 carries the least information about vowel identity, exhibiting less between-category separation than all other cues. This is not surprising given that F0 is not considered an important cue to vowel identity.

As is to be expected, vowels differing in quality are most separated in the F1-F2 panels. The F1-F3 and F3-F2 panels both display increased separation between the neighboring outrounded [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] and inrounded [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`], and unrounded [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] and outrounded [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`], compared to when plotted along F1-F2, which points to the importance of F3 for these vowels. Interestingly, the almost complete overlap between [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] in F1-F2 space overall remains when F3 is considered, even if some individual differences in the amount of overlap exist. Most talkers produce these two vowels very close in F1-F2 space, and only slightly separated in F2-F3 space, while others display a continued overlap when considering F3. For reference, one talker of each type are displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:swe-merge). This would seem to suggest that F3 might carry less importance as distinctive feature for [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] than previously established [c.f., @fant1959; @fant1969].

(ref:swe-merge) The effect of including F3 for the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] distinction. **Panel A** shows two example talkers with overlapping [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] in F1-F2 space. **Panel B** shows how considering F3 affects the space: for talker SW_028, there is very little effect of F3, thus maintained [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] overlap, while for talker SW_027, separability increases.

In order to quantitatively asses whether the distinction between closely neighboring unrounded and rounded categories increased when F3 was considered, the category separability of these vowels was calculated based on F1 and F2, and subsequently compared against the separability calculated when including F3. If separability were to increase when F3 was added, it would suggest that F3 do contribute to category distinctions. 

The category separability was calculated for the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`] pairs, assessing the effect of F3 on unrounded vs. rounded neighboring categories, and for the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʊ")`] pairs, assessing the effect of F3 on outrounded vs. inrounded neighboring categories.^[To capture possible differences in separability between categories in a contrast, the separability index was first calculated in both directions, that is, both assessing the separability of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] from [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] from [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`], following @xie-jaeger2020. Given that no significant differences in directionality were found, the separability index reports the average separability across the two categories in each contrast.]

Two general observations can be made from Figure \@ref(fig:cat-sep-F3). Category separability was overall lower for some vowels, especially when only F1 and F2 were considered, e.g., the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`] contrasts, presumably demonstrating their overlap in F1-F2 space. Second, including F3 overall increased category separability, however marginally for most contrasts. The contrast that seem to benefit most from the inclusion of F3 is the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] contrast.

Separate LMMs were fit to analyse the by-talker by-category separability for each of the pairs, with cue space as fixed-effect predictor, and talker as random effect. All LMMs indicated a simple effect of cue space, with category separability increasing with the added cue (all $ps < .0001$), which suggests that including F3 does increase separability for all contrasts when by-talker variability is accounted for (see Summary tables in SI XXX).

#### Quantity vs. quality in long and short vowel pairs
To gain more insight into the extent to which there are spectral and temporal differences between long and short vowels, the acoustics of categories within vowel pairs were evaluated. This allows for an assessment of whether quantity and quality distinctions seem to be separate from each other.

As expected, long-short vowel pairs differ systematically in duration (Figure \@ref(fig:duration-densities)). For each vowel pair, the duration densities in Figure \@ref(fig:duration-densities) are overlapping but with two clearly separable peaks (mean duration for the long vowels = `r round(d.SwehVd.forStudy.long %>% filter(Quantity == "long") %>% summarise(mean(Duration)) %>% pull(), digits = 2)` ms, SD = `r round(d.SwehVd.forStudy.long %>% filter(Quantity == "long") %>% summarise(sd(Duration)) %>% pull(), digits = 2)`; mean duration for the short vowels = `r round(d.SwehVd.forStudy.long %>% filter(Quantity == "short") %>% summarise(mean(Duration)) %>% pull(), digits = 2)` ms, SD = `r round(d.SwehVd.forStudy.long %>% filter(Quantity == "short") %>% summarise(sd(Duration)) %>% pull(), digits = 2)`). Overall, the short vowels display less variability in duration than the long vowels, a common pattern for measures with a lower bound.

(ref:duration-densities) Illustrating the systematic differences in duration between the long and short vowel pairs in SwehVd.

d.SwehVd.vowel_pairs %>%

```

All long-short vowel pairs furthermore display spectral differences in F1-F2. In fact, as indicated in Figure \@ref(fig:swe-vowels), formant differences are apparent for *all* vowel pairs, even for vowel distinctions for which duration has been found to be the primary cue---[`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("øː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`], and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`] [e.g., @behne-kirk1997; @haddingkoch1964; @kuronen2000]. The vowel pairs that display larger spectral differences along F1-F2 seem to be [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɑː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("a")`] [in line with e.g., @fant1983; @kuronen2000], but also [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`], which contrasts with previous studies. The large spectral differences in [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`] are presumably due to [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] being produced very low in the SwehVd materials, which leads to a gap along the top-left to bottom-left diagonal between [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`]. Overall, F2 appears to carry more of the spectral variation between the long and short vowel phonemes, as categories display increased separability in the pairwise combination of F2 and duration (Figure \@ref(fig:swe-vowels-all-cues), rightmost column, third row).

In order to evaluate what cue combination would provide the largest separability between vowels in long-short contrasts, the category separability index was calculated for each pair and four different cue combinations: F1-F2, F1-F3, F2-F3 or F1-F2-F3.

Figure \@ref(fig:cat-sep-long-short) shows the comparison of separability indices for all long-short vowel pairs as a function of cue space, separated by vowel height. Figure \@ref(fig:cat-sep-long-short) indicates that category separability is overall higher for some pairs, e.g., [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɑː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("a")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`]. Second, Figure \@ref(fig:cat-sep-long-short) suggests that overall, the F1-F2-F3 combination maximizes separability between the pairs, although the difference to the F1-F2 space is marginal for most pairs. The first two formants thus seem to be the most important cues to long-short vowel pair distinctions, while the inclusion of an additional cue unsurprisingly does not punish the separability. Third, for the F1-F3 and F2-F3 cue spaces, there seems to be two main groups for which either cue space generates the lowest separability index. For the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɑː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("a")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`], and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʊ")`] vowel pairs, the F1-F3 cue space generates the lowest separability, which would seem to suggest the informativity of F2 for distinguishing between these pairs. The second group mainly consists of allophones to /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`/ and /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`/: [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("øː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`]. For these vowel pairs, F2-F3 cue space produces the lowest category separability, highlighting the importance of F1. Interestingly, the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`] pair generates the same separability in the F1-F2 and F1-F3 space, and increased separability in F1-F2-F3 space, which seems to indicate the importance of F1 and F3.

The qualitative findings presented was confirmed by separate LMMs predicting the by-talker separability for each of the pairs from cue space. The LMMs included talker as random effect, and the cue space was treatment coded with F1-F2 as reference category (Summary tables in SI XXX). For all LMMs, the F1-F2-F3 cue space generated the highest separability, however, for all but the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`] ($\bar\beta = .027, SE = .005, p < .0001$) and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`] ($\bar\beta = .015, SE = .007, p < .03$) vowel pairs, this change was significantly indistinguishable from F1-F2 (all other $ps > .06$). For the other comparisons, F1-F2 vs. F1-F3 and F1-F2 vs. F2-F3, the LMMs indicated significant negative changes for both comparisons for all but four vowel pairs: for the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`], there was a simple effect of cue space in the F1-F2 vs. F1-F3 comparison only (in the negative direction), for the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`], and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æ")`] vowel pairs, there was a simple effect in the F1-F2 vs. F2-F3 comparison only (positive for [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`], negative for the remaining vowel pairs). 

The use of a category separability index for the static analysis do make certain assumptions. For instance, the separability index assumes that all dimensions within a cue space matters equally much, which means that it is not possible to assess whether this relation is asymmetrical. That is, in the F1-F2 space, does F1 carry as much information as F2, and vice versa. Furthermore, we know from perceptual work that reduced distance between tokens of neighboring categories affects intelligibility negatively [@bradlow1995; @wright2004], but large separability indices does not really tell us anything about the perceived overlap or not.<!--edit this--> In addition, the pairwise comparisons presented here does not inform us about the entire vowel space: the separability of /i/ from /y/ does not tell us how separable /i/ is from /e/, nor how they all related to each other. In order to come to such conclusions, a different measure of distinguishability would be needed, for instance, models that make predictions about perception...<!--add here, or move--->

To sum up, the results of the static analysis suggests that F1 and F2 are the most important cues to vowel distinctions in Central Swedish. While including F3 in the empirical analyses did not seem to lead to substantially increased category separability for neighboring rounded vs. unrounded contrasts, when modeling the by-talker variability, all simple effects reached significance. This highlights individual differences in the phonetic realization of vowels, and the advantages of expanding empirical analyses to modeling approaches. In addition, even though all long-short vowel pairs differed systematically in duration, they also displayed considerable spectral differences, suggesting that quantity distinctions---long vs. short vowels---are not separate from quality distinctions---high, low, front, back vowels. The comparison of how category separability within each pair changed as a function of cue space, furthermore highlighted the importance of F1 and F2, with F2 carrying much of the informativity for several pairs. For the allophones to /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`/ and /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`/, however, F2 seemed less informative. 

However, we know that formants are not static but rather fluctuate across the signal. A more comprehensive mapping of the acoustics should thus aim to assess the relative contribution of each cue when formant dynamics is considered. The next section thus investigates how much dynamic information adds to the relative weight of cues, and the distinction of vowels.

### Dynamic spectral analysis {#sec:swehVd-dynamics}
First, the empirical data is visualized in formant trajectory plots. The aim is to assess the scope and direction of formant movements across the space, including the extent to which short vowels also display formant movements, and to evaluate claims of diphthongization made in previous work, as well as the hypothesized importance of formant movements for some contrasts.

The second part of the dynamic analysis evaluates whether formant dynamics contributes to the discriminability of Central Swedish vowels. This is done by modeling the spectral cues in separate GAMMs: first focusing on the movements in all 21 categories, then on spectral differences between the long and short vowel pairs, in order to assess what cues are primarily affected by considering formant movements, and to what extent dynamic information add to the relative contribution of each of the cues.

#### Formant movements across the space
Figure \@ref(fig:trajectories) displays the formant trajectories across all 5 time-points for the long and the short vowels. There is movement across time-points for the majority of vowels---importantly, both long *and* short. The scope and direction, however, vary. Considering the scope of movements across vowels, they appear to be larger moving from vowel mid-point to 80% into the vowel, as indicated by the length of the line from vowel label to end of arrow. Most of the formant dynamics thus take place *after* vowel mid-point. The long high front vowels are important exceptions---the dynamics in [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] mostly occur at the beginning of the vowel segment (between 20 and 50% into the vowel), whereas [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] displays movements of almost equal magnitude across the first four time-points. The largest movements overall seem to concern [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`].

(ref:trajectories) The trajectory of all vowels across the five time points, along F1-F2. The arrow indicates the direction of the trajectory and ends at the final time-point, at 80% into the vowel. The vowel label is placed at the third time-point, at vowel mid-point (50%). The first (20%), second (35%) and forth (65%) time-points are represented by points.

In terms of directionality, there is a general tendency of movement towards a more central vowel quality in most of the vowels, both long and short. According to previous studies [e.g., @bleckert1987; @elert2000], the high vowels [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`] tend to be realized with an offglide, which would generate a falling F1 for all four vowels, a rising F2 for [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] and a falling F2 for [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`]. These predictions were borne out for F1 in all cases, but for F2, only for [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`]. Both [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] display very little movement along F2, whereas [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`] moves towards a more central quality, possibly indicating diphthongization ending in [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ə")`] rather than a consonantal offglide. 

Some of the movement could be due to coarticulatory effects from the alveolars in coda ([`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("d")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɖ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("r")`]) on the preceding vowel. Coarticulation would be expected to affect primarily F2, resulting in a centralizing movement in the later part of the segment, when transitioning into the alveolar [e.g., @hillenbrand2001; @stevens-house1963]. The formant movements along F2 from the last point (65%) to arrow tip (80%) in e.g., [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɑː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`], and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʊ")`], might at least partly be caused by such coarticulation. For distinguishing between what appears to be diphthongization and merely formant movement, caused by e.g., coarticulation, Figure \@ref(fig:trajectories) suggests diphthongization in primarily [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`], which replicates previous work [e.g., @eklund1997; @elert2000; @pelzer-boersma2019]. The previously reported diphthongization in [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("øː")`], however, does not seem to be particularly pronounced in this material.

Figure \@ref(fig:trajectories) further demonstrates that some neighbouring categories either start at different locations but end up in the same, or start at similar locations but travel in different directions. For instance, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] are fairly closely located at earlier time-points, but differ substantially towards the end of the vowel segment, while [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`]-[`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("øː")`]-[`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`]-[`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`] start at different locations but end up in approximately the same [c.f., @kuronen2000].<!--add: the overlap found at earlier tps in i-y-e in kuronen, does not seem to replicate here--> Finally, the formant trajectories suggest that the empty spots identified in the vowel space under a static analysis (Figure \@ref(fig:swe-vowels)), may indeed be occupied when vowel dynamics is considered. This is especially true for [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] that travels from the mid-high front to the mid center of the space as the signal unfolds---down to a position closer to its short counterpart, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`]. Given the amount of overlap when static spectral cues are considered (Figure \@ref(fig:swe-vowels)), formant dynamics is likely highly informative for several of these distinctions.

While formant trajectories are useful for illustrating general trends in formant movements over time-points across talkers, they cannot account for individual variation in these movements. The use of a statistical model is a principled way of assessing how category information can predict different acoustic cues, while accounting for individual variation in the data... <!--add here-->

#### Models of formant dynamics
The first set of GAMMs were modeled separately for each cue (F1, F2, F3) and each set of long and short vowels, with gender and vowel as independent variables, and time-points as smoothing function. Random slopes and intercepts for talker were included. Summary tables of all 6 models are included in the SI, Section \@ref(sec:SI-GAMMs). 

The GAMMs suggested a main<!--main??--> effect of vowel on F1 for all vowels in both the long and short vowel sets (all $ps > .008$), except for [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`] ($\hat\beta = .012, se = .014, p > .37$) which indicates overlap with [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] in height (Figure \@ref(fig:m-F1)). The difference in means between the high front vowels [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] were not as substantial as for the other categories, as indicated by the overlapping confidence intervals in Figure \@ref(fig:m-F1) (Figure \@ref(fig:SI-m-F1) in SI visualizes all categories included in the GAMMs for F1).

For F2, there was a main effect of vowel for all long and short vowels (all $p > .037$; see Figure \@ref(fig:m-F2). Figures \@ref(fig:m-F1) and \@ref(fig:m-F2) further highlight the presumable diphthongization in [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`], and how some neighbouring categories overlap in F2 at the end of the vowel segment (e.g., [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`]-[`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`]). Again, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] have overlapping confidence intervals, even if their estimated means differ (Figure \@ref(fig:SI-m-F2) in SI visualizes all categories included in the GAMMs for F2).

```
A main effect of vowel was also found for F3 for all vowels besides [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] ($\hat\beta = -.003, se = .011, p > .80$; all other $ps > .046$). The fact that a main effect of vowel on F3 was only found for the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`] and not the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] distinction, suggests that F3 does not reliably distinguish between the long high front rounded-unrounded vowels, even when formant dynamics is considered. This is in line with the static analysis<!--but check separability--> (Figure \@ref(fig:m-F3); Figure \@ref(fig:SI-m-F3) in SI visualizes all categories included in the GAMMs for F3).^[A main effect of Gender was only found for F2 and the short vowels ($\hat\beta = -.028, se = .01, p > .006$), which suggests that the normalization approach likely reduced some talker-specific differences related to anatomical differences.]

The separate GAMMs fitted to F1, F2 and F3 for the long and short vowels suggest that when formant dynamics is considered, the overlap in F1 and F2 for the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] distinction is likely sufficiently reduced. Considering the absence of main effect for F3, together with the results from the static analysis, it is reasonable to assume that the dynamics in F1 and F2 is presumably sufficient for a reliable distinction between the two categories, and that F3 carries little information for this distinction both under the assumption of static and dynamic spectral acoustics.

For the second set of GAMMs, the effect of F1, F2, F3 and duration on all long and short vowel pairs was modeled in four separate GAMMs, with gender and vowel 
as independent variables, and time-points as smoothing function. Random slopes and intercepts for talker were included. Summary tables of these four GAMMs are included in the SI (Section \@ref(sec:SI-GAMMs)). 

The GAMMs suggested a treatment effect of vowel on all spectral and temporal cues for all vowel pairs (for F1, all $ps > .027$; for F2, F3 and duration, all $ps < .0001$). With the exception of the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`] vowel pair (see also previous section), all rounded vowels displayed lower F3 values, hence more lip-rounding, in their long allophones [e.g., @hadding1976; @stalhammar1973]. The results thus seem to suggest that when formant dynamics is considered, *all* long-short Central Swedish vowel pairs differ in spectral and temporal cues. Among the pairs that displayed smaller, albeit statistically significant, differences in spectral cues are the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] pair predicting F1, and the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`] pairs predicting F3, possibly indicating a tendency for stronger duration dependency, in line with previous perceptual work [@behne-kirk1997].

### Results summary
The results from the static and dynamic analyses in Study 1 suggest that F1, F2, F3 and duration all contribute to the distinction of Central Swedish vowels. While F1 and F2 are or primary importance for most contrasts, F3 does contribute to increasing the separability between some neighboring vowels differing in lip-rounding. Importantly, when accounting for the by-talker variability, the advantage of including F3 increased for most (all?)<!--check--> contrasts. The static analysis furthermore suggested that the inclusion of F3 had less importance for the long-short vowel contrasts as statistically indistinguishable performance was found for the F1-F2 model. Some vowels displayed overlap in the static analysis by increased separability when formant dynamics was considered, as indicated by formant trajectory analysis and GAMMs. It is thus reasonable to assume formant dynamics as auxiliary cue to vowel identity, more so for some contrasts than others, as it adds to the relative contribution of each cue. For instance, the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`] categories displayed substantial overlap in static analyses but increased distinguishibility when analysed dynamically, with the exception of F3 still not reliably distinguishing between [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] in static nor dynamic analyses. 

The dynamic analyses furthermore highlighted that the short vowels also display formant movements, and that for most of both long and short categories, a larger portion of the dynamics resides in the later part of the segment.

The resulting phonetic characteristics of the long and short Central Swedish vowels presented in Study 1, is summarized in Table \@ref(tab:swehvd-vowels). Beginning with the long vowels, there are 4 high vowels. The current acoustic description suggests that none of these are front, rather [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("i:")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] group with [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] as central vowels, and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`] is back [c.f., @pelzer-boersma2019; @schotz2011].^[Whether [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] can still be considered rounded given the high F3 values, is a question for future research.] There are 2 mid-high vowels---[`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] (front) and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] (back)---and 4 lower-mid vowels, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`] (front), [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("øː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œː")`] (both central) and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɑː")`] (back). Given the substantial lowering of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] and its overlap with [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æ")`], it is reasonable to assume one long allophone for /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`/, which is [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`] [c.f., @pelzer-boersma2019].

The short vowel space contains 4 high vowels, two of which are front, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`], one is central [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`] and one back [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʊ")`]. There are 4 mid-high vowels, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`] (front), [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`] (both central), and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`] (back), and 2 low vowels, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æ")`] (front), and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("a")`] (central). The analysis would thus seem to support what @riad2014 anticipated and @pelzer-boersma2019 suggested, more precisely, a vowel system consisting of three height levels only, in contrast to the traditional four height levels system [e.g., @engstrand1999; @riad2014; @engstrand2004]. 

Although suggestions for an updated vowel phonology for Central Swedish are left for future research, the motivation of the summarized acoustics presented in Table \@ref(tab:swehvd-vowels) rests on a pairwise grouping of the long and short vowels, similar to phonological analyses of Central Swedish [@riad2014]. For instance, despite its high position, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] is defined as mid-high, on par with [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`], as both vowels share diphthongizational patterns, and their short versions are both lower than their long counterparts. Furthermore, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`] is front rather than central as its short version is clearly more front than [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`]. Because of their overall centralized positions in SwehVd, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("i:")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] groups with [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`], while their short versions are still clearly front. One could thus argue that both /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("i")`/ and /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("y")`/ are under-specified for the front-back dimension, which would also be the case for /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɑ")`/, as [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɑː")`] is back and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɑ")`] is central.

The phonetic characterization in Table \@ref(tab:swehvd-vowels) suggests that some categories have shifted in comparison to previous work. In order to assess the scope and spread of these changes, Study 2 was conducted.

# Study 2: Vowel category movements over time - from SweDia to SwehVd
The aim of Study 2 was to investigate possible vowel shifts over the last generation by comparing the acoustic characteristics of SwehVd against that of 8 reference talkers in the SweDia materials, along the two primary cues to vowel identity, F1 and F2. Next, the reference materials used for comparison is presented, alongside the distance metric used for assessing potential vowel shifts.

## Methods
### Materials
The materials used for comparison is a database of N = `r n_distinct(d.SweDia2000.forStudy$Talker)` L1 talkers (N = `r nrow(d.SweDia2000.forStudy %>% filter(Gender == "female") %>% distinct(Talker))` female) of Central Swedish that were recorded as reference talkers of Standard Swedish for the SweDia dialect database [ @eriksson2004]. All talkers were L1 talkers of Swedish, born and raised in the Greater Stockholm area or surroundings (provinces of Södermanland, Uppland), and of 20-40 years of age (mean age = `r mean(d.SweDia2000.forStudy$Age, na.rm = T) %>% round(digits = 0)`; SD = `r sd(d.SweDia2000.forStudy$Age, na.rm = T) %>% round(digits = 2)`). The talkers were recorded reading a list of 41 words containing all 21 vowels of Central Swedish (for the complete wordlist used for recording, see Table \@ref(tab:word-list) in SI). Thirty-nine words on the list were monosyllabic, and two were bi-syllabic (*leta*, *flytta*). The target vowels extracted ([`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`]) from the bisyllabic words had primary stress and were thus included in this study.

For the current purpose of serving as a reference point for the SwehVd materials, a subset of the SweDia database was used by excluding all [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æ")`] vowels, as this vowel was recorded by only two of the talkers (leaving a total N of tokens = `r nrow(d.SweDia2000.forStudy %>% distinct(Talker, category, Token))`). All repetitions recorded by a talker were included, even though the variability in the number of repetitions for each vowel across the 8 talkers was substantial.^[Three to 8 repetitions of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɑː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("a")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʊ")`], 6 repetitions of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`], 3 to 14 repetitions of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("øː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] per talker.] The phonological contexts used were the same across talkers (with two exceptions, see Table \@ref(tab:word-list)) but differed across categories. Importantly, none of the contexts were hVd. Outliers were identified and removed following the approach for the subsetted SwehVd dataset used in Study 1 (Section XXX). 
For details on the recruitment, recording, pre-processing and annotation procedure in the SweDia materials, see @eriksson2004.

Given the smaller number of talkers in SweDia, the two databases were of unequal sample sizes overall: N = `r nrow(d.SwehVd %>% distinct(Talker, category, Token))` datapoints for SwehVd, and N = `r nrow(d.SweDia2000.forStudy %>% distinct(Talker, category, Token))` datapoints for SweDia. The regional origin of the talkers matched across databases, age at time of recording (mean age in SweDia = `r mean(d.SweDia2000.forStudy$Age, na.rm = T) %>% round(digits = 0)`, mean age in SwehVd = `r mean(d.SwehVd.forStudy$Age, na.rm = T) %>% round(digits = 0)`) and the relative proportion of male and female talkers were also highly similar (50% female talkers in SweDia2000, 55% female talkers in SwehVd). Any potential effects of differences in gender distributions on the comparison were presumably reduced by the use of normalized vowel data.

Cue measurements from SweDia were extracted in the same way as for SwehVd (Section \@ref(sec:cueMeasures)). To correct for measurement errors in the automatic extraction of cues, the joint multivariate distribution of the five extracted cues (F0, F1, F2, F3 and duration) was estimated for each distinct combination of talker and vowel. This was compared against 5 separate univariate distributions to assess whether the number of identified outliers was driven by one or a couple of the five cues. Points that fell outside of the $0.25th$ to the $97.5th$ quantile of the distributions for each vowel were identified, examined for measurement errors, and subsequently corrected. This followed the approach employed for the SwehVd corpus [@persson-jaeger2023], and strikes a middle-ground between the ideal (manual correction of all tokens) and feasibility.

### Assessing vowel shifts
In order to assess whether the relative placement of the categories in the acoustic space was different between datasets, formant data was visualized in F1-F2 space and distances assessed with the *orthogonal projection ratio*, henceforth $op$ [@stevens-schiel2019].^[Other distance measures are possible, such as Mahalanobi's distance. The primary advantages of using the $op$ is that it considers the overall structure of vowel spaces rather than individual distances, and that it offers a standardized way to compare the degree of category membership across different datasets.] Both visualizations and $op$ calculations were based on measurements at the steady-state portion of the vowel in both datasets---taking the average F1-F2 values across the three mid-points (at 35, 50, and 65% into the vowel). This approach presumably reduced the risk of coarticulatory effects resulting from the use of different phonological contexts between the two datasets.

#### Orthogonal projection ratio {#sec:investigating-change}
The $op$, formalized in \@ref(eq:orthogonal-projection-ratio), compares the position of a single token of a $V_{vowel}$ from a talker, relative to the means of two anchor categories, $U_{anchor}$ and $W_{anchor}$, from the same talker. The anchor categories are selected based on their position in the space relatively to $V_{vowel}$, see Figure \@ref(fig:op). After calculating the $op$ for each token of $V_{vowel}$ from each talker relative to the by-talker anchors, the $op$ is summarized across all tokens for that talker. This procedure is repeated for each of the vowels and their respective anchors for each talker in each dataset and then compared across datasets, in order to assess vowel shifts over time.

\begin{equation}
 op(V_{vowel}) = ( -2 \cdot \frac{((V_{vowel} - U_{anchor}) \texttt{\%*\%} (U_{anchor} - W_{anchor}))}{((U_{anchor} - W_{anchor}) \texttt{\%*\%} (U_{anchor} - W_{anchor}))}) - 1 (\#eq:orthogonal-projection-ratio)
\end{equation}

An $op = 0$ indicates that the vowel $V_{vowel}$ is positioned exactly in the middle between $U_{anchor}$ and $W_{anchor}$, an $op = \pm 1$ indicates that $V_{vowel}$ is positioned exactly on the mean of one of the two anchors, whereas a $V_{vowel}$ positioned somewhere between $U_{anchor}$ and $W_{anchor}$ has an $op$ that varies between $\pm 1$. The $op$ can thus be used as an index of e.g., lowering, fronting, or centralizing.

Table \@ref(tab:opr-table) lists all the vowels $V_{vowel}$ tested along with their corresponding anchor points, $U_{anchor}$ and $W_{anchor}$. These were all vowels for which the overall distance in F1 and F2 vowel means in SwehVd to SweDia, $\geq .85$ standard deviations from the vowel means in SweDia.^[The front `r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("[æː]")` was also included in this subset. Given that it occupies the lowest position in the space, the calculation of $op$ was not possible.]

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:opr-table}The anchors used for calculating orthogonal projection ratio across the two datasets}
\begin{tabular}[t]{c|c|c}
$U_{anchor}$ & $V_{vowel}$ & $W_{anchor}$\\

`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("[ɑː]")` & `r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("[ɔ]")` & `r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("[oː]")`\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To assess the magnitude of differences in $op$ between datasets while accounting for individual variation potential vowel shifts, separate LMMs for each of the categories investigated were fit, predicting $op$ from database, with talkers as random effect. The \texttt{lmer()} function from the \texttt{R} package \texttt{lme4} was used. Example of model code: $op \sim Database + (1|Talker)$. Database was treatment coded with SweDia as reference level.^[The two databases employed different phonological context. One way to control for this difference would be to use random effects by word. However, this was not possible since this random effect would be highly collinear with the database, as SwehVd only used one word context. Indeed, most effects were no longer significant when word was included. Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume that coarticulatory effects from using different phonological contexts would be minimal given that the measurements were extracted from the steady-state of the vowel. Therefore, excluding word as random effect likely had very little effect on the results.]

## Results
Figure \@ref(fig:db-comparison) displays the vowel movements in F1-F2 space across talkers between the two datasets. The figure suggests that a few vowels display considerable stability over time, for instance, the back vowel [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɑː")`], and to a certain extent also [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`], the center vowels [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("a")`], and the front vowels  [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`]. The remaining vowels have all moved to a lower or higher degree. Two general tendencies can be noted. Firstly, several of the vowels that form the edges of the space slightly shift further outwards, causing the overall space to widen. This is the case for [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`], and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`]. Most of the inner vowels either also shift outwards---[`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʊ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`]---or centralize---[`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("øː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`]. Second, these movements lead to neighbouring categories closing in on each other in several cases, e.g., [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`],  [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʊ")`], or increasing their separability---[`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("øː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`].

Figure \@ref(fig:db-comparison) further demonstrates changes in the front part of the space that seem to suggest a series of consecutive movements, where the front vowels, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`], all have traveled further up and front in SwehVd, while [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] have centralized. Finally, Figure \@ref(fig:db-comparison) shows that [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] have lowered substantially compared to SweDia, down to a position close to [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`] (and to [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æ")`]; recall Figure \@ref(fig:swe-vowels)). The already low [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`] has in turn moved further down, presumably constrained by the lower bound and cannot move further.

To quantify these potential vowel shifts, the distances between the category locations in the two datasets were assessed with the $op$. Figure \@ref(fig:orth-dist) visualizes the $op$ of all vowels in Table \@ref(tab:opr-table) in both datasets. By this way of assessing the relative movement between anchor points across datasets, Figure \@ref(fig:orth-dist) indicates that all selected categories have moved over time in the directions suggested by the qualitative analysis in Figure \@ref(fig:db-comparison). The largest differences appear to concern [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`], and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`]. The front [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`] is relatively closer to [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] in SwehVd than in SweDia, which suggest fronting. The [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] is relatively closer to [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`] in SwehVd than in SweDia, as is [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`] to [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œː")`], indicating the lowering of both categories over the last generation. The back [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`] is relatively closer to [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] in SwehVd, indicating back raising over time.

(ref:orth-dist) The relative distance between categories in SweDia and SwehVd. $op = 0$ indicates that the vowel is equidistant between the two anchor categories in Table \@ref(tab:opr-table), positive numbers indicate a position closer to the second anchor vowel, negative numbers indicate a position closer to the first anchor. Pointranges indicate mean and 95% bootstrapped CIs of the $op$ summarized across talkers in each database. The large CIs for the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`] vowel in the SweDia materials likely reflect the tendency of some talkers to neutralize the short /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`/ and /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉ")`/ as [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`].

An estimate of the magnitude of the effect was obtained by fitting separate LMMs for each of the categories, predicting $op$ from database, with talkers as random effects. Summary tables of all 6 models are included in the SI, Section \@ref(sec:SI-LMMs). The LMMs confirmed the directionality of the vowel shifts, and found a main effect of Database on $op$ for all categories (all $ps < .019$), with the exception of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] ($\bar\beta = 0.11, SE = 0.06, p > .06$).

# General discussion {#sec:discussion}
The objective of the present paper was to provide an extensive acoustic analysis of contemporary Central Swedish vowels and to evaluate the extent of vowel shifts over the recent generation. The main findings from both studies are next discussed, alongside methodological considerations and future directions.

## Static and dynamic analyses of the 21 vowels of modern-day Central Swedish
The purpose of the first study was to present up-to-date static and dynamic acoustic analyses of Central Swedish vowels that included both empirical formant data and models of formant dynamics. The first study thus aimed to expand on and complement previous work by 1) the scope of the analysis, performing the same type of analyses on all 21 categories, 2) the materials chosen, using a recently collected hVd corpus with high resolution within and across talkers for a single variety, and 3) the methodological approach employed, with the use of traditional formant analysis, category separability index, trajectory visualizations and models of formant dynamics (GAMMs). Study 1 furthermore aimed to evaluate the hypothesized importance of F3 for contrasting rounded vs. unrounded categories, the extent to which *all* long-short vowel pairs are dependent on duration, and what part of the vowel space is more susceptible to diphthongization.

### Static representations of cue information to vowel identity in Central Swedish
Beginning with the static analysis, the results seem to suggest that the most important cues to vowel identity were F1, F2 and duration, which replicated previous work [e.g., @kuronen2000; @lindblom1963]. For some contrasts, F3 increased separability, highlighting the F3 dependency for certain rounding contrasts. The category separability index calculated for the long-short vowel pairs furthermore suggested...<!--add here--> F1-F2 most important, suggesting that quantity distinctions are not separate from quality distinctions in Central Swedish. The results furthermore suggested that static measurements, while informative, were insufficient to accurately capture the spectral acoustics of some vowels. A more exhaustive description can be achieved by including dynamic analyses, as shown in this paper. 

This was especially true for the [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("æː")`],  [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] distinctions, given the direction and scope of formant trajectory movements across the vowel segment. The analysis of the empirical data furthermore suggested that most of the movement took place at the later part of the segment for the majority of vowels, irrespective of the magnitude of change in F1 and F2. However, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`] constituted important exceptions as they displayed more movement in the first three to four time-points. Of note, the short vowels also displayed formant movements, which seems to signal the importance of vowel dynamics for long and short vowels alike. This has been investigated in work on other languages [e.g., @hillenbrand1995; @watson-harrington1999], but has largely been lacking in studies on Swedish. In terms of distinguishing between diphthongization and merely formant movement, the trajectory plots suggested that...<!--add here-->

### The added value of formant dynamics
GAMMs fit to the data contributed with further insights into the formant dynamics of the vowel space in its entirety as well as for individual contrasts, and allowed for an assessment of the relative contribution of formant dynamics to cue dependencies for neighboring and more distant contrasts. For instance, GAMMs fitted to the long-short vowel pairs indicated that all pairs were reliably distinguished by at least one spectral cue, highlighting the informativity carried by formant dynamics in quantity distinctions. These analyses also revealed the continued overlap in F1 and F3 for [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] and in F1 for [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɔ")`], suggesting that these vowels might be more dependent on duration than other long-short contrasts. 
The GAMMs fitted to the long and short high front vowels separately furthermore suggested that F3 could not reliably distinguish between [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], but that the overlap in F1-F2 was not statistically significant when formant dynamics was considered. This would seem to suggest that even if F3 contributes to increased separability between [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], it does not contrast between the two. However, the dynamics in F1-F2 seems to suffice to distinguish between the two, highlighting the contribution of dynamics relative to static estimates.

What consequences the results presented here might have for the *perception* of Central Swedish vowels should be investigated in future studies. For instance, in a language with a systematic quantity distinction such as Swedish, the role of spectral cues in long-short vowel pair distinctions could be assessed by exposing listeners to synthesized versions where long and short vowel duration is crossed with the allophones' spectral information for any given phoneme. Furthermore, results seem to support claims of the hypothesized importance of formant dynamics for vowel distinctions, more insight into the effect of formant dynamics for vowel perception could be gained from having listeners categorize tokens extracted from different segments of the long vowels, e.g., the first three time-points vs. the three final time-points [c.f., @jenkins1994; @strange1989].

## Vowel shifts
In Study 2, the acoustic characteristics of SwehVd was subsequently compared to that of 8 reference talkers of Central Swedish from the SweDia materials recorded approximately one generation ago, in order to investigate the scope and spread of vowel changes noted in Study 1 [some of which, previously reported in @pelzer-boersma2019]. The aim was to present a broad-scale comparison by evaluating changes in all but one of the 21 categories, using empirical formant analysis and a distance metric, the $op$.

Several vowels had shifted quite considerably compared to earlier work on Central Swedish [c.f., @fant1969; @kuronen2000]. Two of the most important shifts concerned the fronting of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`] and the centralization of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], where [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʏ")`] appeared to maintain their positions as high front vowels, while [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] had centralized to the mid-center part of the space. Compared to the SweDia reference materials, the shifts in [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɪ")`], [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] were not as substantial as for other vowels, which suggests that these changes had begun already in 1999, and then continued throughout the first two decades of the 2000s [see also, @pelzer-boersma2019].^[Unfortunately, @pelzer-boersma2019's study on diphthongization only included the long vowels, it is therefore difficult to know whether the fronting of the short vowels was as pronounced in 2019.]

The high front vowels form a particularly interesting part of the space given that several possibly related processes might be ongoing. Besides the centralization of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], the visualizations and GAMMs suggested that F3 could not reliably distinguish between the two vowels.<!--check--> These findings conflicted with previous work on Central Swedish [e.g., @fant1969; @fujimura1967; @kuronen2000], and would seem to indicate that the contrast might primarily be supported by dynamics (as differences, albeit small, were found for GAMMs predicting F1 and F2), or by additional acoustic cues not investigated in this study. There is of course also the possibility that listeners might disambiguate the two categories using primarily visual cues or linguistic information, or perhaps these two categories are not distinguished at all, which would suggest a merger in process among these talkers. A merger might be driven by relaxation of lip-rounding, as supported by the higher F3 values found for [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`]. 

Both of these processes---centralization and relatively sustained overlap---could however be explained by [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] being produced as damped versions. The presence of a damped [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɨː")`] would be supported by the lower F2 values, as the consonantal offglide in [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɨː")`] lowers F2 [@engstrand2000]. A merger of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] into [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɨː")`] has been observed among younger talkers in other regions in Sweden. @gross2020 concluded that several of the talkers of Gothenburg Swedish in their study whose [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] had a horizontally centralized quality closer to [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], merged the two categories into [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɨː")`]. If centralization of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] is a prerequisite for the merger, as suggested by @gross2020, what we see here might be the beginning of a merger in process. A future scenario might involve the loss of the defining feature lip rounding in [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] if a merger continues, given its weaker perceptual salience [as hypothesized by @gross2020].^[A parallel exist in iotacism in Norwegian and Swedish dialects [@eliasson2000], characterized by the loss of lip rounding resulting in vowel shifts such as [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] to [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] for monophthongs, and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("øy")`] to [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ei")`] for diphthongs. Iotacism describes a feature loss for a fairly unusual phonological characteristic---rounded front vowels. Talkers that merge because of iotacism would not necessarily produce [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] as the damped [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɨː")`], which could potentially explain the vowel patterns of some talkers in SwehVd that merge the two vowels but have a rather fronted [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] without an offglide consonant element.] 

Impressionistic listening by the author did support the presence of a buzzing sound, similar to [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɨː")`], among the majority of talkers in SwehVd, both male and female. The strength and scope of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɨː")`] varied across talkers, from a relatively strong [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɨː")`] (17 talkers), to a weaker buzzing sound (12 talkers), or more of a consonant element similar to [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("j")`] (3 talkers). Interestingly, several of the talkers that did not produce any apparent final consonant glide or buzz (11 talkers), seemed to have overall less retracted [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], hence supporting the hypothesized link between centralization and consonantal offglide. Further insights into these individual differences can be gained by studying the SwehVd materials on a talker-specific level.

The changed placement of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] might have affected the surrounding front vowels. For instance, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] was *not* the most fronted vowel for some of the talkers who do not centralize [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`]<!--(e.g., SW_005, SW_015, SW_020)-->. This would seem to suggest that the fronted placement of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] might be conditioned on a more centralized position of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`]. The order and cause of these events is of course unclear. For instance, the raising of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] could be pushing back [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`]---a push chain shift [for reviews of chain shifts, see e.g., @king1969; @martinet1952]. However, what might be causing [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] to move remains unclear, given that the neighbouring vowel [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] substantially lowers. A future scenario might involve [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] once more descending to a position closer to its shorter counterpart, and closer to the position it occupies in the latter part of the segment (see Figure \@ref(fig:trajectories)). Such a change would potentially result in a sparser front space, possibly setting the stage for a more compact system overall. Alternatively, the backing of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`] could be pulling [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] upwards---a pull chain shift. A pull chain shift could hypothetically involve further movements downstream, for instance, a centralization of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ʉː")`], a lowering of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("uː")`], or a general backing of the entire system. Future studies should investigate the support for either hypothesis in more detail for further insight into the possible causes of the movements.<!--add brand et al here-->

@brand2021 present a principled way to study co-variation in vowel change, to identify leaders and laggers, while controlling for known sources of variation such as anatomy and socio-demographic information. Chain-shifts are hypothesized to be causally related, where the shift in one vowel sets off changes in other vowels [@gordon2002; @hay2015; @maclagan-hay2007]. What @brand2021 label structural relationships accounts for co-variation related to phonological factors, such as shifts in an entire phonological class, so that all back vowels front, system-wide evolutionary pressure, i.e. the drive towards symmetry [@boersma1998] and vowel spaces that maintain or even maximize contrast or dispersion [@liljencrants-lindblom1972; @martinet1952; @schwartz1997]. The movement in the upper front part of the space might thus be related to structural co-variation where the centralizing of i and y (perhaps by stylistic or sociolinguistic reasons) makes I and Y travel front to maximize contrast. Pull - a travelling vowel leaves a vacuum, a push - a travelling vowel inkräktar in another vowel's space [@gordon2002; @lubowicz2011]. Future studies should aim for assessing which of these factors might be driving the shifts.


Other noticeable changes outside of the high front area concern [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`], that have both lowered since 1999. The lowering of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`] was anticipated by e.g., @riad2014, and confirmed in @leinonen2010 and @pelzer-boersma2019. Even if [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`] has lowered compared to SweDia, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("øː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`] are still located beneath [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`], which suggest a backing rather than lowering of /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`/ in position before retroflex segments [c.f., @riad2014]. Furthermore, the difference in placement of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`] might result from a presence (SweDia) or lack of (SwehVd) neutralization of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`] into [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`]. In both materials, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`] precedes /r/ (SwehVd - *hörr*, SweDia - *dörr*), and in SweDia, [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`] is considerably closer to [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`] than in the SwehVd. If this result holds, it would suggest that the previously documented merger of short [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ø")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`] might have lost its importance in Central Swedish over the last generation [@stahle1965; @wenner2010; but see @kotsinas1995 for younger Stockholm talkers].

## Methodological considerations
Methodological considerations for the present study concern 1) methods chosen to support claims about ongoing changes in the vowel space, 2) the choice of how to measure some of the acoustic cues, 3) materials used for comparing vowel changes over time, and 4) measures of category separability. Firstly, many acoustic-phonetic studies often include systematic listening by trained phoneticians, validated through measures of inter-rater reliability [for a review, see @cucchiarini1995; @gross2020; @kuronen2000; @pelzer-boersma2019]. In this study, proposals of the presence of a possible ongoing merger and/or centralization of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], and the absence of merger of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("œ")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɵ")`], would all receive stronger support if supplemented by systematic (and not impressionistic) listening. Furthermore, the $op$ accounts for each vowel's movement between two anchor vowels separately, as such, this measure does not take the entire system into accounts and hence can miss patterns of co-variation within and across talkers. A more principled way of assessing vowel change could be to adopt a modeling approach similar to @brand2021 that can more easily detect patterns of co-variation...

A second consideration concerns two of the cue measurements, F0 and duration, and how they were measured and evaluated. Here, the average F0 across the vowel segment was reported. However, pitch contours have been known to influence perceived duration and prominence of vowels [e.g., @gussenhoven-zhou2013]. One could therefore claim that a more accurate acoustic representation of vowels should have included pitch contours. Similarly, the temporal analysis of the effect of duration on long-short vowel pairs could be supplemented with measures of consonant ratios [e.g., @pelzer-boersma2019; @schaeffler2005]. Both of these methodological considerations can be addressed in future studies as the SwehVd database is publicly available in an online repository (<https://osf.io/ruxnb/>).

Third, different phonological contexts were employed for recording of the two databases, which can constrain claims made about vowel changes given differences in potential effects of coarticulation. This limitation was partly mitigated by selecting the steady-state portion of the vowel for comparison. A more comparable database would of course strengthen claims of vowel shifts. Unfortunately, given that existing databases on Central Swedish display substantial differences in word context, number of talkers recorded, number of repetitions per word, and the demographics of talkers (Table \@ref(tab:previous-work)), there would inevitably be some loss in comparability irrespective of what reference materials would have been chosen for comparison. The SwehVd sought to address this issue by recording hVd words, with the intention of enhancing comparability in studies on Central Swedish, and with the welcome side-effect of facilitating cross-linguistic investigations.

Forth, and finally, as for measures of category separability and GAMMs...do perceptual models instead???<!--add here-->an alternative to assessing the vowel distinctions would be to model the predicted effect of...

# Conclusions
The present study has reported on the acoustic properties of Central Swedish vowels and how they have changed over the last generation. The spectral and temporal cues investigated all contributed to distinguishing between the 21 vowels in the Central Swedish vowel space, with varying weight. <!--add here on liprounding, importance of dynamics, and long-short vowels-->More insight into formant dynamics within and between quantities have been gained by the dynamic analysis presented, which is also of value for cross-linguistic research. 
What has been gained with the broad-scale approach of characterizing the *entire* vowel space adopted here, is of course lost in terms of detailed investigations of individual vowel contrasts. There is certainly a lot more to say about the centralization of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("iː")`] - [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], the potential loss of lip-rounding in [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("yː")`], the direction of vowel shifts, and lowering of [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛː")`], among other things. The acoustic descriptions outlined in this paper, together with the publicly available SwehVd database, can provide a reference point for future investigations into these acoustic events and beyond.

## Additional information on Study 1

### Neutralization of short /e/ and /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`/ {#sec:SI-hedd-hädd}
Figure \@ref(fig:SI-hedd) demonstrates that the short allophones of /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("e")`/ and /`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`/ neutralize as [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`] in Central Swedish.

(ref:SI-hedd) The *hedd* and *hädd* words in the SwehVd vowel data in F1-F2 space. Points show recordings of the *hedd* and *hädd* words ([`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("ɛ")`]) by 44 native talkers in the database, averaged across the five measurement points within each vowel segment. Word labels indicate word means across talkers. Since *hädd* and *hedd* resulted in the same allophone, all *hädd* words are excluded from the subset used in this study. This facilitates comparison of, for example, densities across vowels (see diagonal of Figure \@ref(fig:swe-vowels-all-cues)).

```{r SI-hedd, fig.width=base.width*1.5, fig.height=base.height*1.5, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="(ref:SI-hedd)"}
d.SwehVd %>%

### The effect of different measurement points {#sec:SI-measurement-points}
Figure \@ref(fig:SI-time-points) visualizes the SwehVd vowel space under four different assumptions about measurement points. The figure suggests that the use of different measurement points primarily affects vowels for which formant dynamics are particularly important, e.g., [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("eː")`] and [`r linguisticsdown::cond_cmpl("oː")`]. 

(ref:SI-time-points) The SwehVd vowel data in F1-F2 space, faceted by the time points used for measuring formants: averaging across the first three time-points (at 20, 35, and 50% into the vowel; **panel A**), averaging across the mid three time-points (at 35, 50, and 65% into the vowel; **panel B**), taking the mid time-point (at 50%; **panel C**), and averaging across the final three mid-points (at 50, 65, and 80% into the vowel; **panel D**). Points show recordings of each of the 21 Central Swedish vowels by the 44 L1 talkers in the database. Vowel labels indicate vowel means across talkers. Long vowels are boldfaced. Vowels that mismatched intended label are excluded (`r signif((d.SwehVd %>% filter(Transcribed_vowel != "targeted") %>% nrow() / d.SwehVd %>% nrow()) * 100)`% of all recordings).

### Cue matrix plot in unnormalized Hertz {#sec:SI-raw}
Figure \@ref(fig:SI-swe-vowels-all-cues-hz) displays the pairwise combinations of the five spectral and temporal cues---F0, F1, F2, F3 and duration---in raw Hertz. For F0, there are two overlapping but separated peaks, reflecting the overall difference in vocal tract size for the two groups of female and male talkers in the database.

(ref:SI-swe-vowels-all-cues-hz) The SwehVd vowels in unnormalized Hertz space. Points show recordings of each of the 21 Central Swedish vowels by the talkers in the database in all five cue spaces, averaged across the three midpoints. Vowel labels indicate vowel means across talkers. Ellipses show bivariate Gaussian 95% confidence interval of vowel means. Note that, unlike in Figure \@ref(fig:swe-vowels), axis directions are not reversed. Vowels that mismatched the intended label are excluded (`r signif((d.SwehVd %>% filter(Transcribed_vowel != "targeted") %>% nrow() / d.SwehVd %>% nrow()) * 100)`% of all recordings).

### Sampling-with-replacement approach to op
The two datasets were of unequal sample sizes: N = `r nrow(d.SwehVd %>% distinct(Talker, category, Token))` datapoints for SwehVd, and N = `r nrow(d.SweDia2000.forStudy %>% distinct(Talker, category, Token))` datapoints for SweDia. In order to address this imbalance, the SwehVd materials were down-sampled to approximate the size of the SweDia for the calculation of the $op$. The sampling-with-replacement procedure included 1000 bootstrapping rounds. At each round, a sample of 840 tokens from the SwehVd was extracted by first randomly selecting 8 talkers (4 female) from the database, and then randomly selecting 5 tokens per vowel from each talker, with replacement. The $op$ was calculated at each round, and finally averaged across the 1000 rounds for a comparison against the $op$ calculated for the SweDia materials.
